## Description
APIs allow web developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications. Sometimes an API lets us interact with the page more easily. Other times, an API lets us send and retrieve data from other services, such as GitHub. In this module, you'll look at a few of the most important APIs built directly into the browser, beginning with the Document Object Model, or DOM. In this module, youâ€™ll work on a personal project: building a task-tracker app called Taskinator. Taskinator will allow you to organize your personal to-do list items by using a dropdown menu to change the task status and move the task into To Do, In Progress, and Completed lists.

What You Will Learn

By completing this module, you'll learn how to:
- Explain and identify the document object and its relationship to HTML
- Use the window object for local and session storage
- Use DOM API methods to select and dynamically generate HTML elements and content
- Use DOM API methods to handle events such as key presses and mouse clicks
- Set time-based events using time functions
- Write event-driven functions
- Research Web API documentation to implement new and unfamiliar interfaces
